# The 586 Dynasty - Project Instructions

## Deployment
- Do NOT modify `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` or the deployment pipeline
- GitHub Actions deploys automatically on push to main
- After code changes, commit and push to main — the workflow handles the rest
- Never deploy manually via `gh-pages` or any branch-based method
